//! LocalStorage reader with copy-to-RAM semantics.
//!
//! Safety model: the live game files
//! are NEVER opened with SQLite, never written to, never chmodded and
//! never kept open. Each tick we byte-copy `LocalStorage.db` (+ journal)
//! into a tmpfs snapshot dir, verify the source did not change mid-copy
//! via `mtime`, and query only the private copy, which is deleted right
//! after. From the game's perspective this is indistinguishable from a
//! backup tool: no SQLite locks are ever taken on the live files.
